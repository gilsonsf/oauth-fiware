## Shared attributes

When you authorize an application through OAuth, you can select which attributes
you want to share with the application.

After you sign in with your credentials, you will see a page with a drop down
menu. In this menu you can select the attributes from your profile that the
application will be able to access.

Once you are finished, click the Authorize button to finish with the
authorization process.

<!-- ## Third-party applications list

Look at the vertical menu on the left and click on the "Linked accounts" option.

In this page you can see a list of the applications in which you are authorized
and important information related to them.

You can also delete applications. When you click in the arrow you will see a
"Revoke access" button. It shows a modal where you can

## Two Factor Authentication

Two Factor Authentication, also known as two-step verification, is an extra
layer of security for authenticating a user. In any security system, there are
three authentication factors which can be used: something the user knows,
something that he owns and something that he is. Two factor authentication uses
the first two: a combination of username and password (knwoledge) and a physical
token (possession.)

In KeyRock’s implementation of two factor authentication, the physical token is
the users’ smart phone thanks to an app. This app will, after being correctly
set up, generate unique time-based passwords (also know as verification codes)
that will authenticate the user in combination with the right username and
password. The app needs no internet connection to generate the verification
codes after being set up.

### Requirements

You will need to install a third party app that implements the Open MFA
standards defined in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) (HOTP: An
HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) and in
[RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) (TOTP: Time-Based One-Time
Password Algorithm).

!!! important We recommend
[Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=es)

### Enablig two factor authentication

To enable it you must log into KeyRock and head to your settings menu. A two
factor section is there with all the instructions to follow. In summary, you
will need to:

-   Provide a question and its answer (keep it secret!)
-   Scan the provided QR with the application or insert the secret manually
-   Insert the code generated by the application in Keyrock

### Sign in

Once two factor authentication is enabled, your loging process will have a new
step. After providing your username and password you will be asked for the
verification code generated by your app.

!!! note For convenience, you can remember your computer and no verification
codes will be asked when you log in from it. Use this option only in trusted
computers.

### Disable two factor authentication

Simply log into your account, head to settings and disable it in its respective
section. Once disabled, you can log in normally in all computers.

### What happens if i lose my phone or uninstall the app

As a security measure in case of lost or theft of the smart phone or the app, we
also ask for a security question and a secret answer to be provided on the
activation process. This question and answer can be used to disable two factor
authentication with out need to authenticate.
